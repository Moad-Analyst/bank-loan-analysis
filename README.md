# Bank Loan Report üè¶
A comprehensive data analytics project on bank loan data using Excel & Power Query for data Cleaning and Transforming MySQL for database management and Power BI for data visualization and validation

## Introduction
This data analytics project aims to enhance our understanding of the bank's loan portfolio by developing key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations. We will calculate and monitor total loan applications, funded amounts, and amounts received, analyzing these metrics on a month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) basis. We will also assess average interest rates and debt-to-income ratios (DTI). KPIs for good and bad loans will be established, and a loan status grid view will provide comprehensive insights. Various charts will visualize monthly trends, regional analysis, loan terms, employment length, loan purposes, and home ownership impacts. Finally, a 'Details Dashboard' will offer a holistic view of key loan-related metrics for efficient access to critical information.

## Problem Statement
1. **Total Loan Applications**
2. **Total Funded Amount**
3. **Total Amount Received**
4. **Average Interest Rate**
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**
6. **Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI‚Äôs**
7. **Loan Status Grid View**
8. **Metrics to be shown: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received**

## Transforming and Cleaning 
- **_Converting Date Columns from Text to Date in Power Query_**

1. **Add a Custom Column**:
    1. Go to the **Add Column** tab.
    2. Click on **Custom Column**.

2. **Create a Custom Column**:
    1. In the **Custom Column** dialog box, enter a name for the new column.
    2. Enter the following formula in the **Custom Column Formula** box:
        ```plaintext
        = try Date.FromText(Text.Middle([last_payment_date], 7, 4) & "-" & Text.Middle([last_payment_date], 4, 2) & "-" & Text.Start([last_payment_date], 2)) otherwise null
        ```

3. **Remove the Original Column**:
    1. Right-click on the original date column (e.g., `last_payment_date`).
    2. Select **Remove**.

4. **Rename the New Column**:
    1. Right-click on the new custom column.
    2. Select **Rename** and enter a suitable name.

5. **Change Data Type to Date**:
    1. Select the new custom column.
    2. Go to the **Transform** tab.
    3. Click on **Data Type** and select **Date**.

6. **Apply Changes**:
    1. Go to the **Home** tab.
    2. Click on **Close & Apply**.

Repeat these steps for all necessary date columns. After performing all these steps, the date columns will be correctly converted from text to date format.

- **_Formatting Date Columns for MySQL Compatibility_**

To ensure the data load process goes smoothly and to align with the default format in MySQL, I formatted the date columns to "yyyy-mm-dd". This standardization helps avoid any issues during the import process into MySQL.

### Steps to Customize Date Format in Excel

1. **Open Your Excel File**:
    - Open the Excel file containing the date columns you want to format.

2. **Select the Date Column**:
    - Click on the header of the column containing the dates to select the entire column.

3. **Open Format Cells Dialog**:
    - Right-click on the selected column.
    - Choose **Format Cells** from the context menu.

4. **Choose Custom Format**:
    - In the **Format Cells** dialog box, go to the **Number** tab.
    - Select **Custom** from the list on the left.

5. **Enter the Custom Date Format**:
    - In the **Type** field, enter the following format string:
        ```plaintext
        yyyy-mm-dd
        ```

6. **Apply the Custom Format**:
    - Click **OK** to apply the custom date format.

7. **Verify the Formatting**:
    - Ensure that the dates in the selected column are now displayed in the "yyyy-mm-dd" format.

By following these steps, you can customize the date format in Excel to ensure compatibility with MySQL, facilitating a smooth data import process.

## Key Insights

**Let‚Äôs weave these insights into a narrative that highlights their significance:**
- The bank received a substantial number of **loan applications‚Äî38.6K in total**. This reflects the demand for financial assistance, which could be driven by various factors such as economic conditions, personal needs, or investment opportunities.
- The funded amount of **$435.8M indicates the bank‚Äôs commitment to supporting borrowers**. Understanding this figure helps us appreciate the scale of financial transactions involved.
- The majority of loans issued **(86.2%)** fall into the ‚Äúgood‚Äù category. These loans are likely associated with lower risk profiles, making them safer investments for the bank.
- However, the **13.8% of ‚Äúbad‚Äù loans** represent potential risks. Monitoring this segment is crucial for risk management and ensuring the bank‚Äôs financial stability.
- Responsible borrowers who fully paid their loans **(11.64%)** positively contribute to the bank‚Äôs **revenue**. However, **charged-off loans (13.17%) are concerning, affecting the bank‚Äôs profitability**. **Analyzing patterns behind these defaults informs future lending strategies**.
- Analyzing loan applications by employee length provides insights into employee performance and efficiency. Purpose categorization informs product development.

## Recomendatios
- **Implement dynamic interest rates** that adjust based on borrower behavior. For example, if a borrower consistently pays on time, **offer rate reductions**. Conversely, **increase rates for higher-risk borrowers**.
- **To enhance decision-making efficiency**, focus on areas with higher application volumes but lower funding rates. Identifying potential bottlenecks or issues in the loan approval process can lead to better resource allocation and improved loan outcomes.
